## Description

This application functions as the backend for a social media platform. It includes API routes that manage user accounts, enable the creation, modification, and deletion of posts, and handle reactions to those posts. All generated data is stored in a MongoDB database.


## Installation

To get the app running, you need to install Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. Once installed, you can launch the app by executing `npm run start` from the command line. Since it lacks a graphical user interface, you'll need an API client like Insomnia to interact with the database.

## Usage

In your API client, enter the URL for the desired route. Detailed information about these routes is available in the `routes/api` directory. If necessary, include the JSON object required to perform the action. Descriptions of the models can be found in the `models` directory.
